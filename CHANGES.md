# Changelog
## 3.6.3
* [FIX] The ``join_url`` util has been tuned to encode the URL properly when the path is present. That led to the invalid URL being built.

## 3.6.2
* Resolve a couple of security concerns by updating `cryptography` package to `42.0.4`.
  * [High] cryptography NULL pointer dereference with pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates when called with a non-matching certificate and private key and an hmac_hash override
  * [High] Python Cryptography package vulnerable to Bleichenbacher timing oracle attack
  * [Moderate] Null pointer dereference in PKCS12 parsing
  * [Moderate] cryptography vulnerable to NULL-dereference when loading PKCS7 certificates

## 3.6.1
* Remove unintended quoting of the column char in the API URLs

## 3.6.0
* Introduce send_each and send_each_for_multicast methods
* Add deprecation warnings to send_all and send_multicast methods, because they use the API that
  Google may deprecate soon. The newly introduced methods should be safe to use.

## 3.5.0
* [BREAKING] Drop support of **Python 3.7**

## 3.4.1
* [FIX] The batch URL is composed incorrectly, which causes an HTTP 404 response to be received.

## 3.4.0
* Refactored  ``async_firebase.base.AsyncClientBase`` to take advantage of connection pool. So the HTTP client will be created once during class ``async_firebase.client.AsyncFirebaseClient`` instantiation.

## 3.3.0
* `async_firebase` now works with python 3.12

## 3.2.0
* ``AsyncFirebaseClient`` empower with advanced features to configure request behaviour such as timeout, or connection pooling.
Example:
```python

from async_firebase.client import AsyncFirebaseClient, RequestTimeout

# This will disable timeout
client = AsyncFirebaseClient(..., request_timeout=RequestTimeout(None))
client.send(...)
```

## 3.1.1
* [FIX] The push notification could not be sent to topic because ``messages.Message.token`` is declared as required attribute though it should be optional.
``messages.Message.token`` turned into Optional attribute.

## 3.1.0
* The limit on the number of messages (>= 500) that can be sent using the ``send_all`` method has been restored.

## 3.0.0
Remastering client interface
* [BREAKING] The methods ``push`` and ``push_multicast`` renamed to ``send`` and ``send_multicast`` accordingly.
* [BREAKING] The signatures of the methods ``send`` and ``send_multicast`` have been changed.
  * Method ``send`` accepts instance of ``messages.Message`` and returns ``messages.FCMBatchResponse``
  * Method ``send_multicast`` accepts instance of ``messages.MulticastMessage`` and returns ``messages.FCMBatchResponse``
* New method ``send_all`` to send messages in a single batch has been added. It takes a list of ``messages.Message`` instances and returns ``messages.FCMBatchResponse``.
* ``README.md`` has been updated to highlight different in interfaces for versions prior **3.x** and after
* Improved naming:
  * ``messages.FcmPushMulticastResponse`` to ``messages.FCMBatchResponse``
  * ``messages.FcmPushResponse`` to ``messages.FCMResponse``
  * ``utils.FcmReponseType`` to ``utils.FCMResponseType``
  * ``utils.FcmResponseHandler`` to ``utils.FCMResponseHandlerBase``
  * ``utils.FcmPushResponseHandler`` to ``utils.FCMResponseHandler``
  * ``utils.FcmPushMulticastResponseHandler`` to ``utils.FCMBatchResponseHandler``
* Type annotations and doc string were updated according to new naming.

## 2.7.0
* Class ``AsyncFirebaseClient`` has been refactored. Communication related code extracted into base class.

## 2.6.1
* ``async_firebase.encoders.aps_encoder`` no longer clears ``custom_data`` dictionary, as this causes subsequent notifications to not get any content in ``custom_data`` dictionary.

## 2.6.0
* Add object for sending Web Push.

## 2.5.1
* Fix WebPush type annotation

## 2.5.0
* Adds field ``notification_count`` to ``AndroidNotification`` message.

## 2.4.0
* [BREAKING] Drop support of **Python 3.6**
* Update dependencies
* Make implicit optional type hints PEP 484 compliant.

## 2.3.0
Method ``client.build_android_config`` has been adjusted, so when ``data`` parameter is passed but the value is not set (equal to `None`),
turn in into ``"null"``

## 2.2.0
async_firebase now works with **Python 3.11**
* Removes ``asynctest`` as it is no longer maintained [ref](https://github.com/Martiusweb/asynctest/issues/158#issuecomment-785872568)

## 2.1.0
  * ``messages.Notification`` object now supports attribute ``image`` that allows to set image url of the notification

## 2.0.3
A few new error types have been added to support the errors that FCM API may return:
- InvalidArgumentError
- FailedPreconditionError
- OutOfRangeError
- UnauthenticatedError
- PermissionDeniedError
- NotFoundError
- AbortedError
- AlreadyExistsError
- ConflictError
- ResourceExhaustedError
- CancelledError
- DataLossError
- UnknownError
- InternalError
- UnavailableError
- DeadlineExceededError

## 2.0.2
  * Adjust type annotations for some errors:

  **async_firebase/errors.py**
```python

class AsyncFirebaseError(BaseAsyncFirebaseError):
    """A prototype for all AF Errors.

    This error and its subtypes and the reason to rise them are consistent with Google's errors,
    that may be found in `firebase-admin-python` in `firebase_admin.exceptions module`.
    """

    def __init__(
        self,
        code: str,
        message: str,
        <<< cause: t.Optional[Exception] = None,
        >>> cause: t.Union[httpx.HTTPStatusError, httpx.RequestError, None] = None,
        http_response: t.Optional[httpx.Response] = None,
    ):
```

    **async_firebase/messages.py**
```python
class FcmPushResponse:
    """The response received from an individual batched request to the FCM API.

    The interface of this object is compatible with SendResponse object of
    the Google's firebase-admin-python package.
    """

    def __init__(
        self,
        fcm_response: t.Optional[t.Dict[str, str]] = None,
        <<< exception: t.Optional[Exception] = None
        >>> exception: t.Optional[AsyncFirebaseError] = None
    ):
```

## 2.0.1
  * Fix ``TypeError`` on create ``AsyncFirebaseError`` subclass instance

## 2.0.0
  * `push` method now returns a `FcmPushResponse` object, that has a fully compatible interface with SendResponse object of the Google's firebase-admin-python package.
  * `push_multicast` method now returns a `FcmPushMulticastResponse` object, that has a fully compatible interface with BatchResponse object of the Google's firebase-admin-python package.
  * The aforementioned methods may still rise exceptions when assembling the message for the request.
  * A bunch of exceptions has been added.

## 1.9.1

  * [FIX] Invalid batch requests fixed in``push_multicast`` method.
  * [FIX] Data mutation issues that lead to unexpected behaviour fixed in ``assemble_push_notification`` method.

## 1.7.0

  * Make _get_access_token async

## 1.6.0

  * Add support of Python 3.10
  * Fix typos in README.md

## 1.5.0

  * Update dependencies

## 1.4.0

  * Added channel_id option to Android config ([spec](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/fcm/rest/v1/projects.messages#AndroidNotification))

## 1.3.5

  * [FIX] Adjust APS encoder in order to properly construct background push notification.

## 1.3.4

  * [FIX] Set properly attribute ``content-available`` for APNS payload. The attribute indicates that push
  notification should be considered [background](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/pushing_background_updates_to_your_app).

## 1.3.3

  * [FIX] Use numeric representation for boolean attributes ``mutable-content`` and ``content-available``.

## 1.3.2

  * [FIX] Encode ``Aps`` message according to APNS [specification](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/generating_a_remote_notification)
  * [FIX] Util ``cleanup_firebase_message`` to remove null values for dict object.
  * [CHORE] Update dependencies

## 1.3.1

  * [FIX] ``APNSPayload`` message no longer support attribute ``custom_data``

## 1.3.0

  * [FIX] APNS custom data properly incorporate into the push notification payload. So instead of passing ``custom_data``
  as-is into payload and by that introducing one more nested level, extract all the key from ``custom_data`` and
  put them on the same level as ``aps`` attribute.

## 1.2.1

  * Added verbosity when making request to Firebase

## 1.2.0

  * Added instrumentation to cleanup Firebase message before it can gets send. This is requirements that Firebase put on
  us, otherwise it fails with 400 error code, which basically says that payload is not well formed.

## 1.1.0

  * Update 3rd-party dependencies:
    - `google-auth = "~1.27.1"`
    - `httpx = "<1.0.0"`

## 1.0.0

  * Remastering main client.
    * method ``build_common_message`` completely dropped in favor of concept of message structures (module  ``messages``).

    * the signature of method ``push`` has changed. From now on, it expects to receive instances of ``messages.*`` for
      Android config and APNS config rather than raw data, which then has to be dynamically analyzed and mapped to the
      most appropriate message type.

    * static methods ``build_android_message`` and ``build_apns_message`` renamed to ``build_android_config`` and
      ``build_apns_config``.

    * static methods ``build_android_config`` and ``build_apns_config`` return ``messages.AndroidConfig`` and
      ``messages.APNSConfig`` respectively and aimed to simplify the process of creating configurations.

  * Introduce module ``messages`` the main aim is to simplify the process of constructing Push notification messages.
    The module houses the message structures that can be used to construct a push notification payload.

  * Fix CD workflow. Make step ``release`` dependent on ``create-virtualenv``.

  * Update ``README.md`` with more examples.

  * Every request to Firebase tagged with ``X-Request-Id``

## 0.4.0

  * Method ``push()`` no longer has parameter ``alert_text``. The parameter ``notification_body`` should be used
   instead.

## 0.3.0

  * Fix version

## 0.2.0

  * Update README.md

## 0.1.0

  * First release on PyPI.
